# ArcadeRacing

Small mobile prototype WIP

- Currently only has a car and a not good input system that supports both keyboard and mobile. It uses a basic sphere to simulate arcade feeling. Inspired by Kenney's old tweet.

To-Do:
- [ ] Add a rotation effect on turning 
- [ ] Particle for tire 
- [ ] Particle for tire smoke
- [ ] A small map to test and feel better

For future:
- Maybe Mirror integration before going further
-
